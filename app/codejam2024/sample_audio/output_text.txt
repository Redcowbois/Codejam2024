Introduction
Consider the algebraic equation: 𝑥2 + 1 = 0
Formally, we can write:
𝑥2 + 1 = 0 ⟹ 𝑥2 = −1 ⟹ 𝑥= ± −1 = ±𝑗
We refer to 𝑗=
−1 as an imaginary number or imaginary unit
In this video, we will review basic properties of complex
numbers and functions of complex variables

Notation
• Complex numbers are commonly used in mathematics and 
several branches of sciences and engineering:
‒ In mathematics, physics, and other areas: −1 ≡𝑖
‒ In electrical engineering: −1 ≡𝑗 (to avoid confusion with current)

Basic number sets
• Non-negative integers: ℕ= 0,1,2, ⋯
• Signed Integers: ℤ= ⋯, −2, −1,0,1,2, ⋯
• Rational numbers:     ℚ=
±𝑎
𝑏 ∶ 𝑎, 𝑏 ∈ℕ and 𝑏≠0  
• Irrational numbers: 
 𝕀= 𝑎∉ℚ: 𝑎= lim
𝑛→∞𝑎𝑛 where 𝑎𝑛∈ℚ
 
Examples: 2, 𝜋= 3.1415…, 𝑒= 2.7182…
• Real numbers: ℝ= ℚ∪𝕀

Complex numbers
• The set of complex numbers is denoted by ℂ
• Formally, a complex number 𝑧∈ℂ is an ordered pair of 
real numbers: 
𝑧= 𝑎, 𝑏 where 𝑎, 𝑏∈ℝ
• Using 𝑗=
−1, we often express complex numbers in 
the form 𝑧= 𝑎+ 𝑗𝑏 
where
𝑎= Re 𝑧 represents the real part of 𝑧               
𝑏= Im 𝑧 represents the imaginary part of 𝑧

by the conjugate of the denominator

Polar form
We refer to 𝑧= 𝑎, 𝑏= 𝑎+ 𝑗𝑏 as the Cartesian (or rectangular) 
form of 𝑧, since we can think of it as a point in a 2D Cartesian plane:
Alternatively, we can represent 𝑧in terms of polar coordinates:

Terminology
𝑟= 𝑧= magnitude (or absolute value) of 𝑧
𝜃= ∠𝑧= angle of 𝑧
•
When using a calculator to compute 𝜃= tan−1
𝑏
𝑎, you may need
to add ±1800 if 𝑧= (𝑎, 𝑏) is in the 2nd or 3rd quadrant
•
Euler formula
𝑒𝑗𝜃= cos 𝜃+ 𝑗sin 𝜃

Polar form
𝑧= 𝑎+ 𝑗𝑏
= 𝑟cos 𝜃+ 𝑗𝑟sin 𝜃
= 𝑟(cos 𝜃+ 𝑗sin 𝜃) = 𝑟𝑒𝑗𝜃
