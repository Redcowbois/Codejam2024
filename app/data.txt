Northrop Frye's typological approach to biblical interpretation not only reveals 
patterns connecting the Hebrew Bible and New Testament, but more importantly serves a 
crucial theological purpose: it provides an intellectual framework for understanding the 
Bible as a unified Christian text rather than a collection of disparate Jewish and Christian 
writings. Through his analysis of metaphor, archetypes, and typological relationships, Frye 
demonstrates how literary structure itself becomes a tool for theological unification. 
At the heart of Frye's unifying approach is his understanding of metaphor as "the 
controlling mode of thought" in the Bible. Operating through the logic of "this is that" 
metaphor enables identification through symbolic correspondence that is "illogical, or 
rather analogical" (Frye, 31-32). This metaphorical foundation becomes the basis for 
connecting biblical texts. 
Frye's analysis of paradise imagery exemplifies how this metaphorical thinking 
creates unity. By tracing the motifs of trees and water from their loss in Genesis to their 
restoration in Revelation, Frye reveals what he calls "archetypal" patterns that span the 
entire biblical narrative (Frye, 35-36). These patterns demonstrate how the Bible's ending 
intentionally recalls and fulfills its beginning, creating a coherent theological whole 
(Fishley, Lecture October 21, 2024, slide 15). 
This unity is further reinforced through Frye's concept of typological relationships, 
where Old Testament events prefigure their New Testament fulfillment. The New 
Testament thus becomes not just a sequel to the Hebrew Bible but its interpretative key, 
viewing the Old Testament as "essentially a prophecy of what is going to happen later" with 
Christ's coming (Frye, 36). This typological reading transforms potentially disparate texts 
into a single salvation narrative centered on Christ. 
Ultimately, Frye's approach demonstrates how literary analysis can serve 
theological purposes. By revealing intricate patterns of metaphor, archetype, and typology, 
he provides a scholarly foundation for reading the Bible as a unified Christian text (Fishley, 
Lecture October 21, 2024, slide 22). His structuralist method thus becomes more than just 
literary criticismâ€”it becomes a way of intellectually justifying the Christian understanding 
of scripture as a coherent whole centered on Christ's redemptive work.
